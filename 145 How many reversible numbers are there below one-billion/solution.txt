There are no 1-digit solutions.

For ab to be a two-digit solution, a+b must be odd and less than 10, with neither a nor b zero. There are twenty pairs.

For abc to be a three-digit solution, a+c must be odd and greater than 10, 2b must be less than 10. Five choices for
b, 20 choices for ac, 100 solutions.

For abcd to be a four-digit solution, a+d must be odd and less than 10, neither a nor d can be zero, b+c must be odd and less than 10. Twenty choices for ad, thirty for bc,
600 solutions.

There are no five-digit solutions.

For abcdef to be a six-digit solution, a+f, b+e, c+d
must all be odd and less than 10. a and f cannot be zero.
20 choices for af, 30 for be, 30 for cd, 18000 solutions.

For abcdefg to be a seven digit solution:
   a+g odd and greater than 10
   b+f even and greater than 10
   c+e odd and greater than 10
   2d less than 10
5 choices for d, 20 for ce, 25 for bf, 20 for ag, 50000 solutions.

Eight digit solutions are like 2-, 4-, 6-digit solutions.
abcdefgh; a+h, b+g, c+f, d+e all odd and less than 10,
neither a nor h can be zero. 20*30*30*30=540000 solutions

There are no nine-digit solutions.

In general, moving forward, there are 20 * 30^(n-1)
2n-digit solutions, no 4n+1-digit solutions,
and 5 * 20**(n+1) * 25**n 4n+3-digit solutions.
